# Cerberus

This was a demo for a hackathon (won first prize), not something you'd actually want to use, but it's the kind of stuff
that wins hackathons, essentially it's just a glorified version of the
["did you mean" mitmproxy addon](https://github.com/sujaldev/mitmproxy-addons).

* Detects and blocks malicious URLs.
* Geo-block websites having servers in a particular country (used [this](https://github.com/Ne00n/yammdb)).
* Analyze the traffic generated by a website in a sandbox and determine if it's safe to use (TODO).
* It can also perform ad-blocking (didn't complete it but was able to show a demo by intercepting some traffic directly
  in mitmproxy).
